# Hate-Speech-Detection
Course project for Natural Language Processing 
This project involves hate speech detection using transformer models like BERT and ELECTRA using tensorflow.
We are using the Davidson dataset of tweets and applying preprocessing intitially.
Then we train it on pre trained transformer models, accuracy needs improvement.
